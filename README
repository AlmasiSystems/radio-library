Radio Library
=============
Version 0.8

Radio Library is a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) application designed to manage a physical music collection, radio show playlists, and other features needed by radio stations. It was originally developed for KDVS 90.3fm in Davis, California and open sourced in December 2012.

Notes
-----
The initial release is marked as "version 0.8" as the application is very feature complete but may still be rooted in the needs of KDVS - efforts need to be made to modernize and genericize the application.

Licensing
---------
This application is available under the MIT license.

Please contribute patches and report issues at https://github.com/KDVS/radio-library/issues.

Note that this application contains other projects (such as the Zend Framework and phpThumb) which are covered
under separate licenses. Please refer to their included documentation for that information.

Installation
------------
This application has been tested under CentOS 5.8 with PHP 5.1 and MySQL 5.0.

Standard LAMP installation should be applied. Copy the application into a directory such as /var/www/html/ and configure Apache to AllowOverride (or move the contents of every .htaccess into your Apache config).

You will need to manual initialize the database with the script included in db/. By default a user named 'admin' with password 'admin' will exist. You must change this password before deploying your site to the public.
